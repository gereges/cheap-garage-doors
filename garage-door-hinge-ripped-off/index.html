The hinges did not rip. If it�s a regular hinge, and assuming there are three hinges on the door, if only one hinge is broken, you can remove the whole broken hinge so that the door will close, or if one side has completely torn away from it�s surface, you can separate the hinge at the pin so the broken piece will come off, leaving the good half in place. You’ll have to ensure that the garage door opener and the cord are connected properly. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screws that are in the tracks to secure it to the garage door frame.
