Not all garage door openers have a battery backup feature, but those that do ensure your garage door will continue to open and close when the power goes out. Then, use a ladder to get up to your actual opener. If it is made by chamberlain/liftmaster and there is a battery backup logo on it, then you either have a battery backup already, or your system is ready for one to be installed. The effort will be rewarded when the power goes out and you need to get your vehicle out of the garage or when you come home in a howling storm and the power is out.
